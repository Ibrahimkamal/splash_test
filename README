# Project Name

This project is a small ecommerce application that supports two services: orders and carts.

## Getting Started

To start with this project, you need to build the cloud infrastructure by following these steps:

1. Authenticate your machine with Azure.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform.
3. Run `terraform plan` to review the infrastructure changes.
4. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the cloud infrastructure.

Once the cloud infrastructure is available, you can obtain a connection string for sending and receiving events to the eventHub created. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the "sharedaccesspolicy" tab.
2. Create one claim for sending and another one for receiving.
3. Obtain the connection string.

## Configuration

In the project, you will find a `.env` file. Follow the example provided to add the necessary connection strings and other values like the database name and password. These values are already defined in the docker-compose file.

You will also need to do the same with the connection string in the service bus.

## Running the Project

Once the `.env` file is properly configured, you can run the following command to create the database and start the Nest project:
